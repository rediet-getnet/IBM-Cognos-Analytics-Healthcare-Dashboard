Project Overview

In todayâ€™s data-driven world, the ability to effectively analyze and visualize data is crucial for making informed decisions, especially in the healthcare sector. This project focuses on leveraging IBM Cognos, a powerful business intelligence tool, to create a series of visualizations that provide deep insights into healthcare data. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and key metrics that can help improve patient care, optimize hospital operations, and facilitate strategic decision-making.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:

Analyze Patient Demographics: Understand the distribution of patients by age, gender, and medical conditions to identify prevalent health issues and demographic trends.

Track Hospital Admissions: Analyze hospital admission patterns over time to identify peak periods and seasonal trends, helping to manage hospital resources effectively.

Evaluate Hospital Performance: Compare billing amounts and patient outcomes across different hospitals to identify areas for financial and operational improvements.

Assess Insurance Coverage: Examine the distribution of patients across various insurance providers to understand coverage trends and potential gaps.

Monitor Medication and Test Results: Track prescription trends and test outcomes to ensure effective patient treatment and identify common medical issues.


## Instructions for Recreating Visualizations

1. **Load Data into IBM Cognos:**
   - Ensure `healthcare_dataset.csv` is uploaded and available in your Cognos environment.
   - Create a data module using this dataset.

2. **Create Visualizations:**
   - Navigate to the dashboard or report creation area.
   - Select the appropriate visualization type (e.g., line chart, bar chart, pie chart).
   - Drag and drop the required data fields into the visualization canvas.
   - Configure the data aggregation and formatting as described in each section above.

3. **Customize Visualizations:**
   - Add titles, labels, and legends to improve readability.
   - Apply filters to focus on specific aspects of the data if necessary.

4. **Save and Share:**
   - Save your visualizations in the desired format.
   - Share the dashboards or reports with stakeholders through Cognos or export them as PDFs.
